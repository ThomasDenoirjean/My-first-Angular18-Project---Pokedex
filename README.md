# My first Angular18 Project - Pokedex 📱

🎓 This project was build after completing the [Angular18 official tutorial](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular) in order to learn deeper Angular18 and TypeScript. As I wanted to focus only on the framework, I used a public API to avoid building a backend.

Thanks to basic features, the app allows you to build a team of six Pokemons and to choose up to four moves by Pokemon :
* get a single pokemon by random 🎲 or by entering their name | pokedex number ℹ️, or search through a list of pokemons by type 🔥 or generation 👶👴.
* for each of your pokemon, browse amongst all the moves 💿 it can learn and select your favorite moves set 📀.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.8.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
